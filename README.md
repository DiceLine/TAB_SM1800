**ECM - Electronic Computing Machine.**

**SM ECM**  (a “system of small” ECM) is a series (family) of control computers created in the late 1970s  – early 1980s with the participation of various countries that were members of the CMEA.

**History**:

More than 30 institutes and enterprises took part in the development: from Bulgaria , Hungary , the GDR , Cuba , Poland , Romania and Czechoslovakia .

In 1974  , by decision of the Intergovernmental Commission for Cooperation of Socialist Countries in the Field of Computer Engineering (IPC CT), the Institute of Electronic Control Machines (INEUM) was appointed the lead organization. Chief Designer - B. N. Naumov , since 1984  - N. L. Prokhorov .

In 1981, a number of managers and developers were awarded the USSR State Prize with the wording “for the development and organization of serial production of the SM 3 and SM 4 complexes of technical and software tools of the international small computer system”

**Intel line**:

It was developed under the supervision of N. L. Prokhorov with the participation of specialists from the Kiev NPO Electronmash . It had a modular structure with the unification of modules via the I41 bus (OST 25.969-83) - a modified Multibus .

**SM-1800**  — 8-bit on the KR580VM80A processor (analogous to Intel 8080 ). Bus — I41. Produced since 1981 at the Minpribor factories in Kiev and Tbilisi :
**<li>SM-1801**  — Basic computer, consists of a mounting block, a central processor module and a system control module (SCM, console). It is the basis of a microcomputer in a frame design for embedding in installations
**<li>SM-1802**  — Basic computer, consists of an autonomous compact unit (ACU), a central processor module (CPM) and a system control module (SCM, console). It is the basis for embedded microcomputers.
**<li>SM-1803**  — Basic computer, similar in composition and purpose to SM-1802, but has a stack design. Overall dimensions in height are 6U.
**<li>SM-1804**
